--Implementation--

* Figure out good ways to display Documentation

--My Comments--
    * Translation
        * Find students willing to translate parts of our plugin?
            * Definitely Core Question group needs to be translated well
            * Does documentation really need to be translated?
                * Maybe just spanish?

    * Token Management
        * Do we need responses to be anonymous?
        * If yes are they truly anonymous?
            * Token submission is Stamped Y instead of DateStamp
            * Still can compare to answers?
                * The First person who answers identity is compromised
            * Can still log IP tho?
                * Confirm with outside IP address check
                    * Mine is always 1:: I think because I am on my local host
                        * This could be Lime survey making anonymous tho
    * Code Clean Up
        * Encapsulate backend calls to a separate class
            * Should we start making our own models for response data Structure?


--Finished--

--Technical--
* Check out time to live for response token - Done works fine
* Get survey title instead of ID for generated report
