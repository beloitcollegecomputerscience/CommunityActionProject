* Once you have created the necessary program for a survey, you must tie your survey to a program in order to get a report on that particular survey.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Note: Each survey must be individually tied to a program for reports to be accurate.**

* To tie a survey to a particular program go to the Home page and select the survey by clicking on its name.
