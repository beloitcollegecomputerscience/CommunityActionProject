<br />

* Next you will see a list of all the available plugins. Locate the one named _Community_\__Action_ and click on the green arrow in the _Action_ column. If there is a red box in the _Action_ column, the plugin has already been activated and you will not need to do this.

* The _Status_ icon for the _Community_\__Action_ plugin should now be a large green arrow (“active”)! The plugin is now ready to be used.  **Only do this for the Community_Action plugin unless instructed otherwise.**
